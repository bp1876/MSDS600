# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains a Python project I developed during my Master’s in Data Science coursework.  
The goal of the project was to scrape tweets in real time, analyze their sentiment, and visualize the results.  

## Features
- Scrapes tweets using the Twitter API (`tweepy`)  
- Cleans and preprocesses text data with `pandas` and `nltk`  
- Performs sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral classification)  
- Visualizes sentiment distributions with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`  

## Example Workflow
1. Connect to the Twitter API using `tweepy`  
2. Collect tweets based on a keyword or hashtag  
3. Preprocess text (remove stopwords, punctuation, etc.)  
4. Apply sentiment analysis  
5. Generate sentiment plots to show overall trends  

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- tweepy  
- pandas  
- nltk  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  

## Results
This project demonstrates the ability to combine data collection, natural language processing, and visualization to extract insights from social media data.
